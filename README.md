## Start the Coordinator

Run the `run_coo_bootstrap` script. This will create all the necessary files to run the network, distribute the tokens to the address you configured, and start the Coordinator.

In subsequent starts you can use the `run_coo` script, to skip the bootstrap step.

## Start Additional Nodes

To start additional nodes you can use the `run_2nd`, `run_3rd`, `run_4th` scripts.
